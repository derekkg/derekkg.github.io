In late 2015 I designed an Arduino Bluetooth A2DP reciever shield in Eagle. I had prototyed a similar design a year prior as a part of a [previous project]({% post_url 2014-01-08-raspberry-pi-based-e36-in-car-infotainment %}), and have finally gotten around to implementing all of the features I wanted. I just recently populated one of the first boards I recieved, and have begun testing. So far, audio playback and USB to Serial communications have proven successful! More details to come.
