I purchased a non-running SSR 125cc pitbike over the fall 2014 semester. After a few attempts at getting it working with a little carburator work, it still wouldn't run reliably. Since winter in Rochester makes it nearly impossible to ride a motorcycle anyways, I decided it would be fun to tear down the engine, CAD as much of it as I can, rebuild it, and have it ready to ride again the spring. This page is an attempt to document my progress on that.

##Tear-down

The first step was a full teardown of the motor.
