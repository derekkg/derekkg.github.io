This system allowsÂ the user full control over the color of Red Green Blue LED's via an intuitive and easy to use android app.

This is one part of a complete in-car infotainment system, see the full infotainment system description [here][1].

Parts list:

+ Arduino Uno  

+ Texas instruments tlc5940  

+ Bluetooth Serial port adapter  

+ HP Touchpad running Android 4.0

The Touchpad is sending commands to the Arduino using the Amarino Arduino library and android application over Bluetooth [2]. The Arduino sends these commands to the tlc5940 which controls the RGB led. The Arduino project and Android application are based on the MultiColorLamp example [here][3] but modified to allow the arduino to communicate with the tlc5940 instead of the RGB led directly using the [tlc5940 library][4]. The reasoning for this is because in its final installation (car) the arduino controls 8 RGB led's not 1. The android application is also being modified to let the user pick a specific color instead of using sliders, and to allow for different timings and patterns.

A full how-to will be posted in the future
