  My name is Derek Gutheil and I am a fifth year Computer Engineering and Mechanical Engineering student at Rochester Institute of Technology.  

  Please pardon the mess, this website is under construction and transfer from an old location. In the meantime, the [projects page](http://derekkg2.github.io/projects/) is kept somewhat up to date, and is a great place to see what I have been working on.
